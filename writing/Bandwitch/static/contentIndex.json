It is unknown whether or not there is any other landmass anywhere else in the world. Anvil Isles is all that humanity knows.\nLegends say that the world was originally the masterpiece of the gods, The Artisans. It was one of their many projects, of which each was made in a similar way, and each was completely unique.\nThis world was not an exception.\nThe Smith struck at the primordial energy to create the Cosmos. The Architect designed the sun and the stars, and The Sculptor moulded the cosmic dust to create land. The Dancer’s moves brought water and The Singer’s breath created wind. The Painter gave the landscape a unique look, inhabiting it with plantlife. And finally, The Author wrote life into being.\nIndividually, their creations were imperfect, prone to collapse; but together they hung in a perfect balance. Everything that rose from the earth eventually returned to it, and then from the earth something rose anew. And so, satisfied with their work, the gods put this world into the universe, and then left, moved on to their next project.\nAnd life flourished until the day The Critic found it.\nThe Critic looked at the world the gods created and became annoyed by their poor worldbuilding. How can it be so big! How can it be so peaceful and so aimless!\nHe wanted strife and conflict. So he raised the oceans and reduced the world to just the Isles. He made rainfalls and hurricanes. He created carnivorous predators.\nBut all that did not satisfy him. There was no moral to the story! No greater meaning to the work! So as his final gift to The Artisans, The Critic created humans. He imparted them with his ambition and his drive for conflict and resolutions. He gave them the knowledge of Magic so they could defend themselves and shape the world to his - or so he thought - will.\nWith that, The Critic disappeared, and the age of humanity began on Anvil Isles."},"database/setting/places/Places-Index":{"slug":"database/setting/places/Places-Index","filePath":"database/setting/places/Places Index.md","title":"Places Index","links":["Anvil-Isles","The-City","The-Town","Art-Block-Desert","Winry's-House","Kim's-House","Robin's-Apartment","Valerie's-Highrise","The-Lighthouse"],"tags":["index"],"content":"\n\nAnvil Isles\n\n\nThe City\n\n\nThe Town\n\n\nArt Block Desert\n\n\nWinry’s House\n\n\nKim’s House\n\n\nRobin’s Apartment\n\n\nValerie’s Highrise\n\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"index","links":["Bandwitch!","main/Story-Index","database/characters/Character-Index","art/Art-Index"],"tags":["index"],"content":"Name: Bandwitch!\n\nStory Index\nCharacter Index\nArt Index\n"},"main/Logline":{"slug":"main/Logline","filePath":"main/Logline.md","title":"Logline","links":["seven-years"],"tags":[],"content":"\nAfter being fired from her job and bombarded by catastrophe after catastrophe, Winry tries to get her band back together as a last resort.\nAfter a less than dramatic fallng-out and seven years of radio silence, band-witch Winry is trying to get her band back together.\n"},"main/Pitch-Document":{"slug":"main/Pitch-Document","filePath":"main/Pitch Document.md","title":"Pitch Document","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"main/Story-Index":{"slug":"main/Story-Index","filePath":"main/Story Index.md","title":"Story Index","links":["main/Logline","main/Synopsis","Outline","Timeline","First-Draft","main/Pitch-Document"],"tags":["index"],"content":"\nLogline\nSynopsis\nOutline\nTimeline\nFirst Draft\nPitch Document\n"},"main/Synopsis":{"slug":"main/Synopsis","filePath":"main/Synopsis.md","title":"Synopsis","links":["database/characters/protagonists/Winry","database/characters/protagonists/Valerie","database/characters/protagonists/Robin","database/characters/protagonists/Kim","graduation","database/characters/secondary-characters/Ellis","The-City","The-Town","seven-years","Bandwitch!"],"tags":[],"content":"After music saved Winry’s life, she promised herself to change the world with music of her own.\nShe entered the school band, and together with her bandmates Valerie, Robin, and Kim, they made a bunch of great songs and put on a bunch of great performances. They lived together, laughed together, loved together. But as graduation came, each had to go their own way, and their dreams of making it big on the stage together didn’t come true.\nWinry and her younger brother Ellis had to sell their old house and move to The City so that she could get an office job and Ellis could go to school. Robin shut herself in and freelanced on whatever jobs she could get. Kim stayed in The Town and settled down, married and had two kids. And Valerie became a big star in The City, but feels utterly trapped.\nNow seven years have passed, and Winry hasn’t made any progress in her career. She distanced herself from all her old friends, her brother started skipping school, and now she is stuck in a job she hates that barely covers rent. That is, until she is finally fired and has absolutely nothing left.\nOut of desperation, Winry and Ellis decide to sell their old stuff still sitting in the old house. That is when she gets a surprise offer from a talent agent. If she can put on a big show together with her old band, they will get a spot in the grand label runner-ups for a shot at becoming the city’s next big thing.\nWill Winry be able to bring the band back together after seven years of radio silence? Can Bandwitch! make it all the way to the top, like they always wanted? And are they prepared to face whatever awaits them there?\nVote now on your phones!"},"main/loose-ideas/Potential-Episode-Names":{"slug":"main/loose-ideas/Potential-Episode-Names","filePath":"main/loose ideas/Potential Episode Names.md","title":"Potential Episode Names","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"heartcore\nworm train (crazy train reference)"},"main/story-parts/Graduation":{"slug":"main/story-parts/Graduation","filePath":"main/story parts/Graduation.md","title":"Graduation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"main/story-parts/Seven-years":{"slug":"main/story-parts/Seven-years","filePath":"main/story parts/Seven years.md","title":"Seven years","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""}}
