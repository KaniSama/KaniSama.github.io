  <p>Amelia Watson arrives in Mythwood and starts living with her aunt Cheryl Holmes and attending Myth High.
  Amelia meets Gawr Gura and they make friends.
  The whole first day in school Amelia gets weird signals from the teachers.
  At the end of the day, Amlia witnesses a murder: English teacher Calliope kills their homeroom teacher Kiara.
  Amelia runs home in shock and throws up.
  Chapter end.
  Volume end.</p><p class='scene'># Volume 1</p><p>Amelia and Gura meet up. Amelia explains the situation.
  Gura proposes they go investigate the murder together, but when they get to the school, Kiara meets them there as if nothing ever happened.
  After looking into Kiara's past and finding photographs from this school dating back 50 years, Gura says she knows a person who could help them learn about weird stuff.</p>
  <p>Gura introduces Ame to Ina, who says the town was built around an ancient shrine that has a mystical aura to this day, and that she, in fact, works as a shrine maiden.
  The shrine has a library that is open to everyone, which the trio visits, yielding no new information, but growing a bit closer together.
  Ina could swear she saw a book in there somewhere that could help them sort this out. But until then, Ame and Gura continue the investigation on their own.</p>
  <p>Ame, Gura and Ina meet in school together, Ina draws Amelia a picture.</p>
  <p>Ame and Gura decide to observe Calli and Kiara's behaviours, but end up only finding out that the two teachers act as if they've never met before.
  Confused, they are trying to sneak-spy on Kiara, but get caught by Calli and told not to pursue this issue further.
  Kiara asks Amelia to stay after classes to sign some documents (the same documents she signed in Chapter 0). During signing, Amelia asks Kiara if she remembers anything, and Kiara says she remembers nothing. Eager to pursue the truth, Amelia presses further, and Kiara starts to remember some things, but then Calli cuts Kiara's head off from behind, soaking Amelia in blood.</p>
  <p>"I am warning you for the last time, Amelia Watson. There are matters in this world that are beyond human understanding. If you continue down this path, you will lose everything."
  Amelia's sight starts to fail.
  "When you wake up, go home. Go home and never look back. Stay blind to the secrets of our world. It's honestly for your own good."
  Amelia wakes up at Gura yelling at her to wake up. </p>
  <p>Amelia asks Gura to explain what's going on. Gura explains to Amelia that there's no turning back if she tells her, and makes Amelia make a choice. If Amelia is not afraid to lose everything, Gura will tell her. But if Ame still values her life, then they can't be friends anymore.
  Ame explains some of her backstory. She had decided she'd change her life in Mythwood, and is not intending to stop now, after she's already made a friend as good as Gura.</p>
  <p>Gura tells her about the secrets this world holds, about the immortals, and about how Death has a list for all mortals, but not a list for mythical creatures; and that's why by involving herself with the mythicals, Amelia will go against nature itself.</p>
  <p>But if Death doesn't have a list for immortals, why did she kill Kiara? </p>
  <p>--? Something happens</p>
  <p>Kiara and Calli start a confrontation right in front of Amelia, setting the forest on fire in the process.
  Ame has to convince Kiara to come to her senses.</p>
  <p>Gura comes in with a wave of water pouring from the sky, extinguishing the flames. Ame bathes her face in the rain, releasing a long, painful scream.
  Volume end.</p><p class='scene'># Volume 2</p><p>Remember that book Ina was looking for in the previous volume? Well, she found it! It transformed her into an eldritch monster, though. And now the Ancient Ones have full control over Ina's body and are going on a rampage. </p><p class='scene'>#</p></div-->
