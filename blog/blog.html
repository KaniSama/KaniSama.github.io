                <p>Roguelike and Metroidvania are polar opposite genres. It's true, just look at them!</p>
                <p>In a metroidvania game everything has to be designed very intricately, so that nothing would feel out of place, and nothing could even in theory lock you out of progression.</p>
                <p>A roguelike, on the other hand, focuses on randomly generating both challenges and powerups, so things don't feel predetermined.<br></p>
                <p>But even despite all the differences, a roguelike metroidvania could still exist. We just need to look at the similarities.</p>

                <p>An idea struck me recently to make a game. I haven't seen a game like this executed well yet, so making one myself is certainly tempting.</p>
                <p>Here is the idea: a <strong>roguelike metroidvania</strong>.<br></p>
                <p>Yes, I know that Dead Cells exists. No, I haven't played it yet. What of it? Dead Cells isn't even a game I'm considering as inspiration. I'm not saying it's not good, it's just not the game I'm looking for (at least that's what I think. As I said, I haven't played it).</p>
                <p>But look! In the next blogpost I'll explain what I think a game like that could look like.</p>
